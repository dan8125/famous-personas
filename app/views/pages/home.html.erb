      Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo
Arles, Sunday, 29 July 1888

My dear Theo,

If you recall, [my last letter] ended with: we're getting old,
that's what is and the rest is imagination and doesn't exist.
<div>
 Now, I said that even more for myself, than for you.
And I said it feeling the absolute necessity for me to act accordingly,
to work, not more, perhaps, but with a more serious conception.
</div>
Now you talk about the emptiness you sometimes feel; that's just the same thing that I have, too...
The new painters, alone, poor, treated like madmen and as a result of this treatment becoming so in fact, at least.

Then remember that you do exactly the same work as these primitive painters,
</div>
<div>


since you provide them with money and you sell their canvases for them, which enables them to produce others.
This is to say that if you do painting indirectly, you're more productive than me,
 for example. The more completely you become a dealer,
 the more you become an artist.

Just as I very much hope to be in the same case...
The more I become dissipated, ill,
a broken pitcher,
the more I too become a creative artist in that great revival of art of which we're speaking.
These things are indeed so, but this eternally existing art and this revival
</div>
<br>
this green shoot growing from the roots of the old felled trunk
these are things so spiritual that a kind of melancholy remains with us

when we reflect that at less expense we could have made life instead of making art.

"The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality,

 for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort."

"To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real.

This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge."

— Carl Jung, from "Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self
